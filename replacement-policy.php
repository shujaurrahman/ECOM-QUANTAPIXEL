            <h2>6. Shipping and Handling Costs</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>If the replacement is due to a defect, damage, or error on our part, we will cover all return shipping costs and provide a prepaid return label.</li>
                <li>If the replacement is requested for reasons other than damage or error (e.g., incorrect size chosen by the customer), you will be responsible for the return shipping costs.</li>
                <li>In both cases, we will ship the replacement product to you at no additional cost.</li>
            </ul>
